# CloverDB Project Code of Conduct
We, as contributors and maintainers of the CloverDB project, pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

# Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and considerate towards others.
- Using inclusive language and avoiding derogatory or offensive comments.
- Being open to constructive feedback and ideas.
- Focusing on the CloverDB project and its goals, rather than engaging in personal attacks.
- Being patient and understanding, especially with newcomers or less experienced contributors.
- Respecting the diversity of opinions and experiences within the CloverDB community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, discrimination, or any form of offensive behavior towards others.
- Intimidation, insults, or derogatory comments, whether written or verbal.
- Trolling, flaming, or personal attacks.
- Unwelcome sexual advances or attention.
- Publishing private or sensitive information without explicit permission.
- Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

# Contributing Guidelines
To contribute to the CloverDB project, we request that contributors adhere to the following guidelines:

- Select or Create an Issue: Before starting work on a contribution, contributors should pick an existing issue from the CloverDB issue tracker or create a new one if the issue does not already exist.

- Claiming an Issue: To prevent multiple contributors from working on the same issue simultaneously, contributors should declare their intention to work on the issue by leaving a comment on the issue thread. This helps to avoid duplicating efforts and allows for efficient collaboration.

- Submitting a Pull Request (PR): When the contribution is ready, contributors should submit a pull request referencing the issue they worked on. This ensures that the changes are linked to the relevant issue and facilitates easier tracking and reviewing of contributions.

# Our Responsibilities

As project maintainers, we are responsible for enforcing the standards outlined in this code of conduct. We are committed to providing a harassment-free environment and will not tolerate any form of abusive, offensive, or unacceptable behavior.

We have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, or other contributions that do not align with this code of conduct. By adopting this code of conduct, CloverDB project maintainers commit themselves to fair and consistent enforcement.

# Reporting Incidents
If you experience or witness any behavior that violates this code of conduct, please report it by contacting the CloverDB project maintainers at [email address]. All reports will be treated confidentially, and the maintainers are obligated to take appropriate action in response to reported incidents.
